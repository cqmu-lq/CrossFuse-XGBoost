## Data Availability
The data used in this study, along with the software code, are made available in this repository to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the findings. The following files are included:

1. **[dataset.csv]**: The dataset used for training and evaluation. Each row represents a compound with its associated features and the maximum daily recommended dose.

2. **[crossfuse_xgboost.py]**: The Python code for implementing the CrossFuse-XGBoost method and performing the prediction.

## Usage
To use the CrossFuse-XGBoost method and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](link_to_requirements.txt) using the package manager of your choice.

3. Run the [crossfuse_xgboost.py](link_to_code.py) script, providing the path to the dataset as an input. Make sure the dataset is in the appropriate format as specified in the script.

4. The script will execute the CrossFuse-XGBoost method and generate the predicted maximum daily recommended dose for each compound in the dataset.

Please refer to the code comments for further instructions on customizing the method or adapting it to your specific use case.
